# Slack Bot for NodeRED

[![RedConnect Approved](https://img.shields.io/badge/RedConnect-Approved-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://www.redconnect.io/addons/slack/)

Simple nodes that interact with the Slack Bot API [Bot Users](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) service.

## Installation

`npm install node-red-contrib-slackbot`

## Quick Start

1) First make a bot integration inside of your Slack channel. Go here:

https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot

Enter a name for your bot. Make it something fun and friendly, but avoid a single task specific name. Bots can do lots! Let's not pigeonhole them.

2) When you click "Add Bot Integration", you are taken to a page where you can add additional details about your bot, like an avatar, as well as customize its name & description.

3) Copy the API token that Slack gives you. You'll need it.

## Implemented Node
